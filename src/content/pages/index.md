# Why Choose Freaky Flyer Delivery?

- #### Unique EQUALIZING Technique Ensures Maximum Exposure

  Our preparation and Equalizing team layer all flyers for a particular delivery suburb or area, one on top of the other in preparation for the delivery. This ensures that when they are put into the householders letterbox the flyers will spread out creating maximum exposure for all of our clients. We also vary the order of the flyers, creating even greater equal exposure for all of our clients on each individual delivery.

- #### Tried & Tested Delivery Method Ensures Maximum Efficiency

  Our tried and tested method of delivery, undertaking delivery on ex Australia Post Honda CT110 motorbikes, with waterproof rear side pannier bags, maximizing our riders efficiency, and ensuring delivery of dry flyers even in the worst winter weather Perth can produce.

- #### Full GPS Tracking, to give you complete confidence that your flyers are being delivered to every single household possible.

  Our Equalizing technique increases the exposure to the householder for all of our clients. Having a smaller client base than our competitors generally means most likely only having two-three additional flyers for delivery, significantly increasing the share of exposure on each delivery.

# We look forward to working with you, please contact our friendly sales team for a quote.
