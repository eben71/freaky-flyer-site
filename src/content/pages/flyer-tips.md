# FLYER TIPS

# BEST PRACTICES FOR FLYERS

1.  Keep the content of a flyer brief - don't overload your read, take into account your typography,  write only the most important information - keep it concise.
2.  Divide your flyer into clear sections - have no large walls of text keep it simple and precise. Large walls of text just bounce off the readers eyes and they will pay no attention.
3.  Try to use bullet points - this condenses the information while also making easier for a reader to read.
4.  Use catchy headlines! - titles such as “HUGE SALE!” and other similar statements capture the reader's attention
5.  Use a call to action - a command or a call to action such as “call now!” or “order now!” tells a reader what they should do after reading the information.
6.  Add directions - what that means is add a shop address or a web address with directions to find you!
7.  Leave contact info - obvious but easily forgotten, the best place for this information is in the bottom section of a flyer.
8.  Proofread your work - a smple mistake can distract the reader from the main message you are trying to tell.
9.  Use a language the target audience will understand - this one is self explanatory, use sentence structure and words that your target audience will understand, keep use of jargon to a minimum.
10. Use testimonials - a good testimonial from a satisfied client can work wonders for your flyer, just make sure they are well written.
11. Use colours - not only is it eye catching but certain colours can be used to invoke a physiological response. Green colours used on a grocery store flyer invokes the response that the groceries must be fresh!
12. Choose the right paper and colour format - thicker and higher quality paper is vastly superior to thin low quality paper, making your advert seem more sophisticated. Printing in colour is always a good way to increase the quality of your advert, compared to black and white.
