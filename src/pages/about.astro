      <p class="lead">
        We started in Perth with a handful of walkers and a mission to give marketers proof of every flyer drop. Today our crew
        spans Perth metro with a dedicated equalising facility and full-time supervisors.

      <h2 id="story-heading">Our story</h2>
      <p>
        Born from print production roots, we noticed too many campaigns lacked transparent delivery proof. We invested in GPS
        hardware, developed a walker training program and built a proof stack that keeps franchises, councils and marketing teams
        aligned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every flyer is touched by our Perth warehouse team before reaching the street. We trim, equalise and kit walker packs so
        quality is consistent – even on large catalogue campaigns.
