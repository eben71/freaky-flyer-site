        <h2 id="story-heading">Where it began</h2>
        <p>
          In March 2014, a new to real estate sales representative sat behind
          their desk fretting over who they could trust to deliver their flyers
          within their real estate area. Struggling to find anyone trustworthy
          enough to “do the right thing” as they certainly didn't want someone
          putting their flyers inside a bunch of catalogues or local newspapers
          reducing exposure immensely, or not delivering their flyers, or worst
          still, the prospect of dumping was a real concern by all within the
          industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          This real estate sales representative was Nick Wren, the founder and
          director of Freaky Flyer Delivery Pty Ltd.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nick decided to put his skills as a long time Postal Delivery Officer
          with Australia Post to work, he purchased himself an ex postie
          motorbike and started delivering his own flyers. Very quickly after
          this, Nick realised there was a serious demand for an honest,
          reliable, trustworthy and accountable flyer delivery service
          throughout Perth Western Australia, hence the birth of Freaky Flyer
          Delivery in 2014 as a Sole Trader business.
        </p>
        <p>
          July 2015, Freaky Flyer Delivery had such a high demand for it’s
          honest, reliable, trustworthy and accountable flyer delivery service,
          becoming a Registered Australian Pty Ltd company, employing full time
          local professional delivery riders, administration and Equalizing
          staff, to service the small to medium businesses of Perth with their
          local flyer delivery requirements.
        </p>
