          At Freaky Flyer Delivery, we understand that print advertising is an
          exposure driven market, which is why we employ strategies to
          drastically maximise our clients' first impression of potential
          customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike some of our competitors, we will never deliver your flyers in
          bulk catalogues or newspapers. We splice and layer every flyer
          together so they spread out inside the letterbox, creating more
          individualised impressions for each campaign.

        <h2>Our equalizing technique keeps every flyer on top</h2>
        <p>
          We superjacent our flyers, stacking them one by one so that when
          riders place the bundle into a residential letterbox the flyers spread
          out. Residents see each flyer individually as they clear the
          letterbox, ensuring a memorable first impression for your campaign.
        </p>
        <p>
          Delivery areas are capped at six flyers per route to avoid overflowing
          households and to keep your brand front and centre.

        <h2 id="coverage">Coverage ready for every drop</h2>
        <p>
          Our delivery zones cover Two Rocks in the north to Rockingham in the
          south, Kalamunda in the east, and the entire west coast in between. We
          constantly look for new ways to expand our operations and deliver a
          greater service to our clients.

          All of our riders are full-time delivery staff who wear GPS trackers,
          enabling our office to oversee every drop and provide peace of mind
          that your flyers have been delivered.

        <p>
          Our Honda CT-110 motorbikes feature waterproof pannier bags so your
          flyers stay dry, even in Perth's toughest winter weather.

          Flyers are required at our Wanneroo warehouse by the Thursday prior to
          delivery—one of the shortest lead times offered in the industry—and

      <div class="service-faq__grid">
        <article>
          <h3>Which areas do you deliver?</h3>
          <p>
            We undertake flyer delivery to residential homes across the Perth
            metropolitan area, from Two Rocks in the north to Rockingham in the
            south, Kalamunda in the east, and along the west coast in between.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3>How much does delivery generally cost?</h3>
          <p>
            Standard flyer delivery on our regular schedule ranges from $66.00
            to $132.00 per 1,000 homes, inclusive of GST. Ask us about exclusive
            runs for solo deliveries when you need the route entirely to
            yourself.

        <article>
          <h3>How do we confirm delivery?</h3>
          <p>
            Riders forward their GPS maps after every shift so we can share
            delivery evidence on request. Field supervisors also undertake spot
            checks to maintain quality.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3>When are flyers due at the warehouse?</h3>
          <p>
            Please deliver flyers to our Wanneroo warehouse no later than the
            Thursday before the scheduled run. Pick up can be arranged for a
            small fee under 10,000 flyers, and is free above that volume.
