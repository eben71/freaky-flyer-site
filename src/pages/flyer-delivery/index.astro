        <div class="approach__copy">
          <p>
            At Freaky Flyer Delivery, we understand that print advertising is a
            exposure driven market, which is why we employ strategies to
            drastically maximise our clients first impression of potential
            customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike some of our competitors, we will never deliver your flyers in
            bulk catalogues or newspapers (we don't even deliver these items!),
            instead we choose to ‘splice’ our flyers, brochures and pamphlets
            together. This splicing method allows our clients flyers to spread
            out in residential letterboxes during the delivery process, which
            results in more individualised impressions for our clients.
            Residents will see every flyer delivered, individually, as they
            remove the items from their letterbox.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, we maintain a reliable fleet of delivery bikes and
            delivery riders, ensuring our distribution operations can continue
            regardless of mechanical breakdown, or even weather!
